			Contributing to mappr's data is easy!
			The map is powered by data from <a href="https://location.services.mozilla.com/" rel="noopener" title="Mozilla Location Services">Mozilla Location Services</a> and
			<a href="https://opencellid.org/" rel="noopener" title="OpenCellID">OpenCellID</a>, each of these platforms have their own 'collector' apps, however I recommend
			you use Tower Collector as it contributes to both.
