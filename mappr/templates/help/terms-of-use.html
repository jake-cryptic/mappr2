	<p>
		Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the https://mappr.uk
		website and the Mappr mobile application (the "Service") operated by absolutedouble.co.uk("us", "we", or "our").
	</p>

	<p>
		Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These
		Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
	</p>

	<p>
		By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms
		then you may not access the Service.
	</p>

	<h3>Termination</h3>

	<p>
		We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason
		whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
	</p>

	<p>
		All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including,
		without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
	</p>

	<h3>Content</h3>

	<p>
		Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics,
		or other material ("Content").
	</p>

	<h3>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h3>
	<p>
		The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects
		without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, Mappr, on its own
		behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly
		disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service,
		including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
		non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade
		practice.
	</p>
	<p>
		Without limitation to the foregoing, Mappr provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no
		representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be
		compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption,
		meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be
		corrected.
	</p>
	<p>
		Without limiting the foregoing, neither Mappr nor any of Mappr's provider makes any representation or
		warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the
		information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or
		error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through
		the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the
		Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
		statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But
		in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
		enforceable under applicable law.
	</p>

	<h3>Links To Other Web Sites</h3>

	<p>
		Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Mappr.
	</p>

	<p>
		Mappr has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or
		practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that Mappr
		shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by
		or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web
		sites or services.
	</p>

	<h3>Changes</h3>

	<p>
		We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is
		material we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What
		constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
	</p>
	<p>
		By continuing to access or use Our Service after those revisions become effective, You agree to be bound by the
		revised terms. If You do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, please stop using the website and the Service.
